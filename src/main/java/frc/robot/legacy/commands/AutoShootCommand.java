/**
 * Keeps the shooter spun up and hood positioned based on live vision distance.
 *
 * Designed for autonomous — runs continuously so the flywheel and hood are
 * always tracking the interpolation tables. When this command is active the
 * superstructure is "hot": the instant a separate command fires the indexers
 * the ball leaves immediately with no spin-up delay.
 *
 * Does NOT require or touch the Indexer subsystem so indexer commands can be
 * composed independently (e.g. sequential auto routines that feed one ball
 * at a time).
